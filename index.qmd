# Preface {.unnumbered}
This is an online version of the [2022 DTM Methodological Framework](https://dtm.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1461/files/DTM%20Methodological%20Framework%20-%202nd%20Edition%202022_0.pdf)

The purpose of this online version is to demonstrate how the 2022 version looks as an online document, in preparation for the drafting of the third version of the methodology.

The online version omits the charts and tables from the original source material, and may include some transcription errors.
